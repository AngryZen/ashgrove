A splinter of [[The Ashgrove School/Reference/World Factions/The Cabal/The Cabal\|The Cabal]] that has managed to hold its own, the Technorati embrace change for the sake of change. The chaos, harnessed for fun and power, of the technological. They care little for people, or the problems their changes bring, only for the personal power and respect of their peers. There are two main factions, nearing a splintering of the group itself.Â 

The main corporate faction refers to themselves as the Builders, though everyone else calls them the Smileys. They are looking to uplift humanity (with them on top) and trying to outmaneuver the Cabal at the same time. The dark underbelly of tech is run by the Bulgars, an eastern European led coalition of magi who use ransomware, worms, botnets, and mundane hackers to gather resources to make themselves comfortable.
