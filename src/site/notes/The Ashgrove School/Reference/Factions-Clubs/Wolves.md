The Wolves are an interesting case study. They are all students of shape changing, and regularly travel [[The Ashgrove School/Reference/The Grounds/The Ways\|The Ways]], setting themselves up for long periods in history, acting as guides, protectors, and sometimes enforcers. They do not reside on the Ways, but near exit points. Their most common cover is as a wolf, though they are not werewolves, usually.
