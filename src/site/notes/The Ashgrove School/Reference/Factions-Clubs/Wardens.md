The Wardens are the students of Protection. They reinforce the physical defenses of Ashgrove, along with the personal defenses of the individuals. They craft scrolls of protection, wards against hostile forces, enchanted items of defense and the like. They have a decent working relationship with the [[The Ashgrove School/Reference/Factions-Clubs/Arcanum\|Arcanum]], though they generally consider them Ivory Tower idiots.
