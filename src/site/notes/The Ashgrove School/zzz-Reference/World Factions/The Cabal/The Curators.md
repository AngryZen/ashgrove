Conservative by nature they worry about the abuse of magic and take steps to curb use they deem unseemly.

The Curators, as a group in [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/World Factions/The Cabal/The Cabal\|The Cabal]], are almost [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/World Factions/The Academics/Academics\|Academics]]. They document, they store away things of interest. One never knows what a Curator might have squirreled away in a vault somewhere. If a Curator is showing interest, it must be novel, or important, to someone!
