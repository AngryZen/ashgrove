Based primarily around the Paths, each faction has a purpose and a responsibility.

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Psychics\|Psychics]] are a voluntary group that put on shows and entertain as a means of practice above and beyond classwork. These students under direction of [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Characters/Masters/Francis Hornblatt, Esq.\|Francis Hornblatt, Esq.]] weave the illusions that help preserve the anonymity of Ashgrove. The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Magic/Path of Energy\|Path of Energy]] and the [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Magic/Path of Mind\|Path of Mind]] weave a false reality.

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Weather Wizards\|Weather Wizards]] work to manage the atmosphere and temperature, keeping things appropriate in season. Energy, Matter, and Chance are their specialties.

The [[Makers\|Makers]] are responsible for the physical structure of the school and the grounds. Usually they need upperclassmen to do the ‘fine detail’ work, but it is good practice in large scale magic to get them to rearrange hills or fill cisterns, or the pool… Matter and Crossroads.

The [[Movers&Shakers\|Movers&Shakers]] act as the local transportation and occasionally entertain with acrobatic stunts, playing three dimensional ‘tag’. Crossroads, Magic.

Usually only advanced students are admitted, but The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wolves\|Wolves]] are shape shifters that travel the Ways and act as scouts, guards, informants, and occasionally enforcers. Body, Crossroads. Occasionally an actual werewolf will join, and can as a first year.

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Diviners\|Diviners]] cast their minds ahead or behind in time and space, trolling through history and the future for information. They love to play the stock market. The Movers&Shakers deal with physical actions, but the Augers deal with the mental. Chance, Crossroads, Magic.

The [[Druids\|Druids]] are a small group of advanced students who do extracurricular work with elementals and werewolves. Chance, Body, Spirit. Occasionally one of [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/World Factions/The Druids of Old Appalachia\|The Druids of Old Appalachia]] will offer to come in and hold sessions with the club.

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Sacred Order of the Veil\|Sacred Order of the Veil]] operate under extreme strictures (which they routinely ignore) to summon the dead to answer questions. Usually they are made to animate a flesh golem to facilitate communication. They have been sanctioned multiple times and shut down twice in school history. Magic, Spirit, Undead

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wardens\|Wardens]] are students who act to protect the school, or specific students. They regularly travel the world via the Ways and are the only group to have blanket permission to do so. Crossroads, Chance.

The [[Witches\|Witches]] are technically not a coven. Covens are not allowed on school grounds, but a group for female students studying the Craft and focusing on Body, Chance, and Crossroads. Effectively a Coven.

The [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Arcanum\|Arcanum]] are associated loosely with the [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wardens\|Wardens]] in that they both protect Ashgrove, but the [[The Ashgrove School/zzz-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Arcanum\|Arcanum]] defend it from purely magical threats and intrusions.
