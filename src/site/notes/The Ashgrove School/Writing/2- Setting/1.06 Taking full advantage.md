[[The Ashgrove School/Characters/Students/Abigail "Tilly" Van Tillingham\|Abigail "Tilly" Van Tillingham]] sat at the end of the table on the stage and picked at her chicken. Mostly she watched and listened as the seniors clustered around [[The Ashgrove School/Characters/Teachers/Frederick Van Der Meer\|Frederick Van Der Meer]]. She had no such need as to be seen and remembered by the teacher, and sipped a sparkling water as she lounged above the masses in her Chiffique silk loungewear. When Frederick said his goodbyes and headed down to mingle, Tilly got up and left her dishes to step outside the dining hall. She went straight to the front door and waited, tapping her foot impatiently. Eventually he emerged from the throng and he saw her as he walked to the front door.

"Tilly, so good to see you little cousin. Shame you have to stay in this House, but perhaps you'll have a breakthrough any day now hmm?" His warmth and charm almost masked his barely concealed disdain for her. Almost.

"Cut the crap cousin. My mother is pissed off and you know why. Fix it." Tilly's words were little barbs of venom directed at the teacher. They seemed to fall short though, as he was unmoved.

"Your mother will have to wait for her little princess to get off her ass and do the work. Even I cared to move you to my house, I cannot until the Masters verify you. Can you fake it with one of the Masters?" He snorted. "Do tell Dorothy I miss her terribly. Perhaps she can pull herself away from Paris long enough to visit you on family day." Frederick walked past her without a second glance and went out into the sunset. 

Tilly glared at his retreating back and then went to the main stairwell and down. She had some more spells she needed to prepare.
