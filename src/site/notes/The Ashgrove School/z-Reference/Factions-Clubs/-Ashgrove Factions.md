Each faction has a purpose and a responsibility.

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Psychics\|Psychics]] are a voluntary group that put on shows and entertain as a means of practice above and beyond classwork. These students under direction of [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Characters/Masters/Francis Hornblatt, Esq.\|Francis Hornblatt, Esq.]] weave the illusions that help preserve the anonymity of Ashgrove. The  Schools of  [[Illusion and Creation\|Illusion and Creation]] and [[Mind Control\|Mind Control]] weave a false reality.

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Weather Wizards\|Weather Wizards]] work to manage the atmosphere and temperature, keeping things appropriate in season. [[Air\|Air]] and [[Water\|Water]] are their specialties.

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Makers\|Makers]] are responsible for the physical structure of the school and the grounds. Usually they need upperclassmen to do the ‘fine detail’ work, but it is good practice in large scale magic to get them to rearrange hills or fill cisterns, or the pool… [[Earth\|Earth]] and [[Water\|Water]]

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Movers&Shakers\|Movers&Shakers]] act as the local transportation and occasionally entertain with acrobatic stunts, playing three dimensional ‘tag’. [[Movement\|Movement]], [[Gate\|Gate]], [[Magic\|Magic]]

Usually only advanced students are admitted, but The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wolves\|Wolves]] are shape shifters that travel the Ways and act as scouts, guards, informants, and occasionally enforcers. Occasionally an actual werewolf will join, and can as a first year. [[Body Control\|Body Control]]

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Diviners\|Diviners]] cast their minds ahead or behind in time and space, trolling through history and the future for information. They love to play the stock market. The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Movers&Shakers\|Movers&Shakers]] deal with physical actions, but the [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Diviners\|Diviners]] deal with the mental. [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]].

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Druids\|Druids]] are a small group of advanced students who do extracurricular work with elementals and werewolves. [[Animal\|Animal]], [[Plant\|Plant]], [[Healing\|Healing]], and [[Earth\|Earth]] are their usual trades. Occasionally one of [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Druids of Old Appalachia\|The Druids of Old Appalachia]] will offer to come in and hold sessions with the club.

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Sacred Order of the Veil\|Sacred Order of the Veil]] operate under extreme strictures (which they routinely ignore) to summon the dead to answer questions. Usually they are made to animate a flesh golem to facilitate communication. They have been sanctioned multiple times and shut down twice in school history. [[Magic\|Magic]], [[Spirit\|Spirit]].

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wardens\|Wardens]] are students who act to protect the school, or specific students. They regularly travel the world via the Ways and are the only group to have blanket permission to do so. [[Protection and Warning\|Protection and Warning]].

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Witches\|Witches]] are technically not a coven. Covens are not allowed on school grounds, but a group for female students studying the Craft and focusing on [[Body Control\|Body Control]], [[Healing\|Healing]], and [[Spirit\|Spirit]]. Effectively a Coven.

The [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Arcanum\|Arcanum]] are associated loosely with the [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Wardens\|Wardens]] in that they both protect Ashgrove, but the [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Factions-Clubs/Arcanum\|Arcanum]] defend it from purely magical threats and intrusions.
