Ask a member of the Academics who is in charge and they will tell you, “No one.” The Academics are the ones hiding in plain sight at Universities. Somehow they get a cozy office, funding, occasionally a class to teach if they get bored, and no one asks them about their research. There are thousands of Academics out there, studying magic, gaining power, and through it all, wanting to be left alone. Drives [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Cabal/The Cabal\|The Cabal]] nuts. Most Academics will help each other out, if it doesn’t require too much effort on their part.

The concept of a ‘group’ is either anathema, or inherent, in the Academic circle. They all assume they are a group, and rivals as well. “Frenemies” might be the best descriptor. They work together, but are all jealous and secretive. A roomful of starving feral cats all silently staring at each other, waiting for a moment of weakness or possibly a stray mouse, would be a reasonable description. Still they do amazing work, if mostly disconnected from the world.

One organization within the Academics is [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Academics/The Order of the Prime Renaissance\|The Order of the Prime Renaissance]], They are primarily concerned with crafting new creatures and new realms. [[Path of Body\|Path of Body]] and [[Path of Crossroads\|Path of Crossroads]] factions vie for the more outlandish and interesting aspects. The Men in Black spend too much time cleaning up their mistakes.

Another Academic organization is [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Academics/The Theurgi\|The Theurgi]]. These are the Academics and armchair mages interested in pushing magic forward in a pure form. The most Ivory Tower of all Ivory Towers, they live in a Universe of pure mathematics and symbolism as they seek to push purely into [[Path of Magic\|Path of Magic]] itself.
