Journeyman/Teacher at Ashgrove 
Brown hair, longish, needs a trim Scruffy beard isn't long enough for a real beard and too long for stubble, blue eyes, dresses 'business casual' Assigned to the 'Secret master' this year, meaning he's teaching everything.

[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Characters/Journeymen/Laurie Vance\|Laurie Vance]] has it bad for him
He doesn't appear to be aware

He is a 'late bloomer' to magic, but his science background has made him very flexible. He is sought after by many groups, but he wants to stay at Ashgrove. While an academic at heart, he sees the [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Academics/Academics\|Academics]] as parasites.
