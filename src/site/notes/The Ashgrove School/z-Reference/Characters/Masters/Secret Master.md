The Secret Master. That they exist is not in doubt. Their hand is felt all over the school. Their influence with the outside factions is unmistakeable. [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/World Factions/The Druids of Old Appalachia\|The Druids of Old Appalachia]] came by the school in force two decades ago and tried to tear it down. The Secret Master’s Second (there was only one at the time, something that was adjusted five years later on an unrelated issue) went out to chat. There were a dozen angry Druids willing to work in concert to trash the school back to bedrock. The Second walked out and spoke quietly with them for a minute and they slunk off without another word. Some students have tried pranking others with messages from the Secret Master. If they mention it before trying they are stopped by older and wiser students. Otherwise they find out this is not acceptable the hard way. The last one was found suspended in midair in the lobby, slowly bleeding to death. He survived. 

His Seconds teach his classes, including his advanced classes usually. Subjects vary.
Current Seconds are [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Characters/Journeymen/Steven Harwood\|Steven Harwood]] and [[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Characters/Journeymen/Laurie Vance\|Laurie Vance]].
