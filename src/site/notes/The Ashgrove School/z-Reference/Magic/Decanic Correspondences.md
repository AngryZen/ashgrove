This table summarizes the key facts about each decan; the 10-degree segment of the zodiacal arc which it subtends, and its governing planet. In addition, each decan is given an associated “sephirah” a “sphere” on the kabalistic “Tree of Life”.

## Decanic Natures:

The following list, in alphabetical order, describes the significance and nature of each decan, and what aspect of reality it governs. Some decans share resonances, much as some magical colleges share spells. The list also details the following:

Aethyr: Every decan has a Lord or Lady, a powerful spiritual entity which adopts one or more appearances in visions or symbolism.

Places: Locations where magic drawn from the decan may be cast more effectively. 

Materials: Using any of these materials, colors, patterns, etc., in magic drawing upon this decan is required. 

## Agchoniôn
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

The decan of noise, music, and hearing, Agchoniôn overlaps somewhat with its neighboring decan, as the air of Isrö vibrates to produce the lilting (or blaring) tones of Agchoniôn. Agchoniôn alone does not convey meaning, however; languages are part of the domain of Naôth.

Aethyr: Hahahaal, Lord of Unstable Effort, most often takes the form of a large yellow swan or of a crowd of people talking in chorus.

Places: Sonar stations, opera and concert houses, wind tunnels or narrow canyons, echo chambers.

Materials: Bats’ ears, dolphin blood, recording tape, seashells, theremin music, parrot feathers, glass shattered by sound, bright yellow-green.

## Akhouiy
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Akhouiy energizes (if that’s the apt term) indolence, drift, ease, and luck, especially “dumb luck” or “fools’ luck.” Not stagnant like Alath, Akhouiy simply “goes with the flow.”

Aethyr: Vevaliah, Lady of Abandoned Success, appears as an attractive red-headed woman with her hair tied up in a black velvet band. She also manifests as a collie, a raven, or a large orange carp.

Places: Casinos, resort hotels, some taverns, much of Faërie, fountains (with coins), wishing wells.

Materials: Four-leaf clovers, rabbits’ feet, upright horseshoes, beer, dice, stones with water-eroded holes through them, the small bone of a sheep’s head, honey, deep orange.

## Akton
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Where the decay of Kurtaêl is most often the physical result of natural processes, its counterpart within Akton is the decadence of the spirit, or the self-created mutilation of soul, culture, or body. Akton instills corruption, debauchery, both the cruel and queasy joys of sin and its debilitation and ravages.

Aethyr: Naber, Lord of Illusionary Success, appears in many guises; a blonde woman in red, a man in a fur robe on his knees, a carrion crow or black crane, and a red-eyed gryphon.

Places: Alcoholic wards, whorehouses, crack dens, certain temples in desert lands, slave markets, the edge of the Abyss.

Materials: Vomit, maggots, vitriol, cocaine, wormwood, venereal pus, pale yellow.

## Alath
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Alath creates satiety, comfort, rest, the steady state, boredom, stagnation, and stasis, and may be crucial in the “damping out” of destructive energies where less compatible decans intersect.

Aethyr: Kaliel, the Lord of Rest from Strife, often appears as a fat man riding on a donkey and drinking wine. Other times, he manifests as an enormous, slumbering bull with the head of a man or leopard.

Places: Old-age homes, cold deserts, still tarns, ghost towns, select gentlemen’s clubs.

Materials: Tortoiseshell, square and cubic shapes, arsenic, ether, morphine or heroin, deep wine-purple.

## Alleborith
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Some see Alleborith as the essential medium of magical transmission, others as the particulate energies of mana, still others as an abstraction for that portion of Barsafael and Anostêr which mages have mapped. In base, however, it is the decan present in magic at its most pure and isolate, the “active” reflection of “passive” Kumeatêl.

Aethyr: Mendial, Lord of Power, most often appears as either an azure dolphin or a blue merman with a trident. In both incarnations, his eyes are golden yellow.

Places: Magical laboratories, pentacles, places of power, ley intersections, mana “wellsprings,” mystic realms of arcane power.

Materials: Mandrake root, orichalcum, azoth, pyramid shapes, black cat whiskers, water from Atlantis, green moonstones, pineal glands, bright azure.

## Anatreth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

While Iudal is transition itself, the act of crossing depends upon Anatreth, the decan of movement, evolution, progress, and speed (fast or slow). Anatreth primarily impels physical movement, but astral or spiritual movement carries much of Anatreth’s impulse within it.

Aethyr: Nithaya, Lady of Swiftness, most often manifests as a blurry image of wings, but sometimes coalesces into a winged dog, or a human figure with a future and past image “ghosted” onto it.

Places: Tornadoes, airports, speedways or freeways, lightning strikes, bullet-trains and their tracks.

Materials: Arrows, bullets, fulgurites, cobra venom, hawk or osprey feathers, methamphetamine, henbane, violet.

## Anostêr
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Some mages theorize that Anostêr, by definition, cannot exist. It comprises that which cannot be done, that which cannot be known, the impossible, the unnamable, the reverse face of knowledge and skill, the void that preceded creation.

Aethyr: Yeichavah, Lord of Effort, traditionally appears as a gray, blind ape or as an enigmatic figure garbed in prismatic robes, its face hidden by a peacock fan. Yeichavah appears in many other forms at whim; many mages remain uncertain that they have actually conversed with (or even summoned) him.

Places: Peculiar stone circles in impossible places, a mirage city in the desert, a hot spring beneath arctic ice.

Materials: The noise of a cat’s passage, books never written, blood from a stone, imperceptible colors.

## Arôtosael
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan drives the cyclic process of creation and destruction in all its facets, from assembling pieces of knowledge to destroying a city in an atomic blast. Arôtosael most strongly irrupts during the intermediate stages, when enough components have appeared to make the result apparent, or when the structure will fall with just one good shove.

Aethyr: Nithael, the Lord of Perfected Work, often appears as either a pale, redheaded man in a reddish-purple gown carrying a wooden staff, or as a winged man with a mirrored sword and helmet. He usually wears a golden bracelet.

Places: Decisive battlefields, particle accelerators, alchemical or chemical laboratories, blacksmith shops, beehives, new forests, seas of seaweed.

Materials: Ram’s horn (and anything else in a Fibonacci spiral), flint, clay, radioactives, E above high C, hammers, sage, murex dye or anything else reddish-purple.

## Atrax
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Where Roêlêd protects the body, Atrax nourishes it. This decan is the day-to-day inner strength of things renewed by sunlight (for plants), food (for animals), or worship (for deities). Atrax shades into health and healing – though more as a steady state than a process – and also into decay (food for bacteria and worms).

Aethyr: Akiah, Lady of Prudence, usually appears in traditional guise as a woman bearing an armload of fruit, grain, or bread.

Places: Supermarkets, bazaars, farmland, compost heaps, restaurants, gas stations, granaries, some fields with secret historical significance.

Materials: Bread, salt, woman’s hair, storax, saliva, fertilizer, peridots, light yellowish-tan.

## Axiôphêth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Axiôphêth may serve as another powerful “anchor” for reality, empowering gravity, weight and mass, and forces holding things in place, often including oppression for its own sake.

Aethyr: Amael, Lady of Oppression, appears as a woman in an indigo robe seated on the rocks. Occasionally she weeps, just as often she has her foot on a man’s throat and her hand wrapped in his hair.

Places: Underneath tons of rock, sun-baked desert flats, labor camps, prisons, sweatshops, particularly oppressive cubicle farms, slave galleys, certain mountains in the Pamirs.

Materials: Lead chains, iron weights, ballast from a ship that has traveled around the world, depleted uranium, indigo.

## Barsafael
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan is the hidden truth, the subconscious mind, primal unconfessed emotions and unknown strengths. Some wizards theorize that Barsafael underlies all the other decans, while others believe that as wizards, philosophers, and scientists explore more of existence, Barsafael’s essence shrinks (or, possibly, continues to create more unknown territories).

Aethyr: Hechashiah, Lady of Ancient Strength, appears as a woman in crimson and white robes with one leg uncovered, or as a crimson and white sea serpent.

Places: Deep beneath the ocean or in hidden caves, cities unknown to mankind, dinosaur burial grounds, fragmentary worlds long forgotten, very old mountaintops, limestone sinkholes.

Materials: Ambergris, petroleum, white noise, artesian water, taproots of plants, “U” shapes, crimson.

## Belbel
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

The decan of pain and torment, of sharpness and shadow, of shock and loss: few mages explore these many aspects of Belbel. Many of the ghostly undead (especially shades and shadows) derive their essence from the emanations of this decan.

Aethyr: Aaneval, Lord of Despair and Cruelty, occasionally appears as a man with the head of a raptor bird; other times, as a black dog; still others, as a man covered in fish or snake scales.

Places: Torture chambers, death camps, deep in the rainforests where sunlight never falls, widows’ walks, shadow-burns left by nuclear blasts, the edges of the Abyss.

Materials: Funeral crepe, surgical steel, rust, ammonia, neurotoxins, dried blood, nettles, purple so dark that it appears black.

## Bianakith
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

If man is the measure of all things, then Bianakith is the template to which that measure is drawn. Humanity (at least potentially) encompasses all the decans, but it is within the medium of meat and bone and desire and thought established by this decan that they must operate.

Aethyr: Mihal, Lord of Perfected Success, appears only in human form – sometimes, in fact, in two human forms (man and maiden), other times as a crowned king of perfect form, mien, and carriage.

Places: Crowded cities, human-scale statuary, portrait galleries, gymnasia.

Materials: Lungwort, liverwort, elm, river clay, human blood or skin, starfish, GI Joe or Barbie doll or any other idealized poppet, ivory.

## Buldumêch
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan energizes wealth and treasure, from giving gold its glitter to building stock-market castles in the air. Within Buldumêch’s penumbra lie concepts as arcane as currency arbitrage and as basic as greed.

Aethyr: Murmux, Lord of Wealth, traditionally manifests as an old man leaning on a staff and wrapped in a woolen mantle.

Places: Banks, stock market floors, gold mines, customs houses, money changers, jewelers, treasure troves.

Materials: Money, anything expensive and hoarded, jackdaw or magpie feathers, cowry shells, sapphires, toad venom, gold.

## Charchnoumis
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan imbues all animal life, bestial thoughts, predation, pack behavior, and such instincts. As a result, Charchnoumis is a very powerful component of human beings, and provides mana for the majority of lycanthropes and other animalistic shapeshifters.

Aethyr: Rohael, Lord of Abundance, appears most often as a great bear, but sometimes as a composite beast such as a chimera or gryphon. When he appears as a human (whether as a camel-driver or a beautiful woman in green), he usually has a blue head.

Places: Zoos, slaughterhouses, nature preserves, forests, fresh animal tracks or kills, watering holes, Mount Ararat.

Materials: Fresh animals’ blood or skin, bloodstones, fresh game spoor, hunters’ weapons, civet musk, hunting-horn music, anything dark blood-red.

## Eneuth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Fire, the untamed element; man’s first mystery. As the elemental decan of fire, Eneuth sparks not just the fires of stars and gas grills but the lively fires of inspiration and lust, of war and demagoguery.

Aethyr: Yirthiel, Lord of Great Strength, most often appears as a golden man or as a three-headed dragon. He occasionally leads yellow-orange or red cattle.

Places: Bonfires, firestorms, tropical or subtropical deserts at midday, war-torn lands to the south, lava flows, magmatic caverns, the Plane of Fire.

Materials: Obsidian, asbestos, sulfur, fire opals, sodium, magnesium, rocket fuel, ash-wood wands, cones, olibanum, garlic, mustard, cayenne pepper, orange-yellow.

## Harpax
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan sends sap through mighty cedars and spangles the ponds with algae. All things green and growing, both harmful and healing, have their taproots somewhere in the decan of Harpax.

Aethyr: Vishiriyah, Lady of Harmonious Change, primarily speaks out of wooden musical instruments, but when she manifests, it is usually as a white dryad clad entirely in blue, red, and yellow flowers.

Places: Sacred groves, rainforests, algal pools, weed-ridden croplands, hedge mazes.

Materials: Green jade, holly, cedar, woodwind music, amanita mushrooms, ivy, coral, forest green.

## Hephesimereth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan is nothing, quite literally. It imbues creation with defeat, emptiness, and loss. Particularly pessimistic mages believe that eventually every decan will wind up in the sack of Aniel.

Aethyr: Aniel, Lord of Defeat, walks with his head down and his dark red, shapeless, hooded robe over him. Only his hands emerge from the drapery, holding an empty sack.

Places: Open abandoned pits, former cemeteries with the bodies disinterred, frozen Antarctic desert, the intergalactic vacuum, places where the ground has been sown with salt.

Materials: Dead batteries, dust from an abandoned house, ashes, mistletoe, no color.

## Ieropaêl
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Second of the elemental decans, Ieropaêl helps solidly anchor reality as the fundamental principle of earth, soil, rock, of the very concept of physicality itself.

Aethyr: Hazael, Lord of Material Gain, traditionally appears as a large man holding a jar of oil. Other common guises include a black centaur and a skin-clad tribesman.

Places: Mountain caves, volcanoes, up-thrust crags, gravel beds and quarries, city parks, fertile land in the north, the Plane of Earth.

Materials: Quartz, talc, slate, oak, lichen, worms, narcissus, orbs, dark brown.

## Isrö
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Air, at peace and in storms, coheres from the energies of Isrö. Not only zephyrs and hurricanes, but also the “lightning strike” of genius, the “airy chatter” of gossips, and the “windy oratory” of politicians derive from it.

Aethyr: Rehael, Lord of Science, traditionally appears as a milk-white, winged horse or as a proud king with a long white beard wearing a white robe. Rarely, he has manifested as a proud man in a white lab coat, holding a lightning bolt.

Places: Windstorms, steppes, inside or atop clouds, on balloons or airships, cities atop plateaus in the east, the Plane of Air.

Materials: Eagle feathers, chalcedony, galbanum, white orchids, helium, bird-bone knives, aspen, pink-white. 

## Iudal
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Boundaries, roads, portals, rivers, bridges, and other liminal and transitional thoughts and things form from the energies of Iudal. Iudal also emerges in concepts of time, distance, and measurement, and powers bridge-trolls.

Aethyr: Ieilael, Lord of Eventuality, holds a key in every form, while habitually shifting between them. Three common ones are that of a long-haired man with ox’s hooves, a winged man, or a gryphon.

Places: Bridges, crossroads, doorways (especially post-and-lintel ones), boundary markers, rivers, interdimensional gates, outdoors during an eclipse, grandfather clocks.

Materials: Keys, two-headed coins, juniper, alexandrites, tobacco, hollow bones, chalk, mirrors, rose-madder, cesium, cornmeal, and amber. 

## Kumeatêl
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Kumeatêl empowers hidden contention and unknown victory, the ace up a sleeve or the corps held in reserve, as well as secrets (especially decisive ones), murmurs, and even some aspects of codes, glyphs, and runes. Where Barsafael is the Unknown, Kumeatêl is the Hidden, the Occult, and thus may be seen to partially embody magic itself.

Aethyr: Elemiah, Lord of Victory, appears in a (literally) legendary number of forms, most characteristically as a stranger in a blue cloak and slouch hat or as a bearded knight of cruel countenance in unreadable heraldry. In neither version are his eyes clearly visible.

Places: Secret laboratories or military bases, hidden rooms or passages, labyrinths, lost cities, conspiratorial fastnesses, pocket dimensions, certain university libraries.

Materials: Artifacts with secrets, the number 13, walnuts, handcuffs, Christmas wrapping ribbon, silk cord, knots with hidden ends, rose (both the flower and the color). 

## Kurtaêl
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Death and fear, decay and disease, all fluoresce with the black energies of Kurtaêl. Vampires, mummies, liches, and many other undead creatures draw upon the power of this decan for their vitality on the material plane, even if they must take its energies admixed with blood or magic to survive.

Aethyr: Menqal, Lord of Ruin, appears as a corpse in chainmail, as a black horse, or as a harlequin figure without arms, among his many forms. He seldom appears as a skeletal figure in a black cowl and cloak.

Places: Graveyards, terminal wards of hospitals, ruined buildings where people have died, plague pits, tombs, marshes, necromantic altars in Haiti, Transylvania, and elsewhere.

Materials: Rowan, cypress, myrrh, contaminated syringes, rats, yew, hellebore, onyx, ebony, jet, pitch, anything black.

## Marderô
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan energizes rebellion against comfort, and anger at injustice – as well as violent reaction born from fear of chaos and disorder. Marderô also drives mutations, changes born of crisis and stimulus, and the concept of the opportune disaster.

Aethyr: Hokmiah, Lord of Sorrow, appears as a man with a lion’s face, occasionally enthroned but more often pacing angrily with a whip.

Places: Revolutionary battlefields or massacres, police stations, some government buildings, meteor craters, disaster sites.

Materials: Hammers, sickles, human blood, pepper, tear gas, axes, five-pointed stars (but not pentagrams), gunpowder, rhino hide, white-flecked azure.

## Methiax
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Where Arôtosael assembles and disassembles matter, concepts, and energies, Methiax creates them – or, rather, creates creation itself. Since (magically even more than mathematically) the final appearance of all matter is inherent within its smallest fragments, the impulse of creation is also the impulse of form. Methiax shapes both realities and dreams without regard for any difference. Some shapeshifters and phantasms draw mana from this decan.

Aethyr: Chabuiyah, Lady of Love, rules Methiax most often as a white centaur garlanded with leaves, though occasionally she appears as a crowned, maidenly Muse.

Places: Artist’s studios, movie theaters and movie sets, counterfeiter’s dens, certain very old vineyards in Greece and Turkey, hallucinations and hallucinogenic spaces, induced dream states, Faërie, copy centers and scriptoria.

Materials: Pyrites, zircons, flashbulbs, eggs, pomegranate seeds, fractals, holograms, hallucinogens, fog, or anything gray.

## Naôth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

What Iudal is to the material experience, Naôth is to the conceptual one – the creator and sustainer of communication, language, imagery, symbolism, and teaching. Not only the media of communication but the urge to communicate arise from Naôth, which connects everything on many levels.

Aethyr: Mebahel, Lady of Peace Restored, appears as a woman reading a book, occasionally bearing a bloody spear.

Places: Radio stations, printers, shared telepathic experiences, shared or archetypal dream states, universities, a few select bars, certain bookshops in London and Paris.

Materials: Vervain, bay leaves, “V” shapes, stringed instruments or their strings, blue-gray.

## Nefthada
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan impels pleasure and delight, thrills physical and mental. Often Nefthada is only perceptible at single, almost painfully perfect moments: the meadow under a rainbow, the first bite of steak, the second swallow of cognac – but its influence is in all those things forever.

Aethyr: Nelokiel, Lord of Pleasure, traditionally takes on the guise of a well-formed man on a richly caparisoned camel or in a luxurious tent.

Places: Almost nowhere – except for perfect moments in time or space. Some truly wonderful gardens achieve correspondence with Nefthada on a continuing basis, as do a very few building interiors.

Materials: Champagne, star sapphires, silk or satin fabrics, morning dew, pure oxygen, bright green.

## Ouare
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan governs constructs, machines, alloys, and vehicles. Some golems, magical cyborgs, and revenants take mana from Ouare.

Aethyr: Heroch, Lord of Success Unfulfilled, usually embodies this decan as a bronze clockwork lion, a mermaid (most often as a warship’s figurehead), a swarthy man with metal-and-ivory teeth, or a chariot-driver with serpents for legs.

Places: Garages, metallurgical laboratories, inside moving vehicles, virtual-reality matrices, the Autobahn.

Materials: Gears and clockwork, plastic, microchips, brass, aluminum, olive-green, any artificial dye such as aniline.

## Phoubêl
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan would seem to embody the Manichaean contradiction, that light cannot exist without darkness to define it. Phoubêl deals equally with both, and thus also with vision, blindness, and irreconcilable conflict.

Aethyr: Yelayel, Lord of Strife, appears alternately clad in noble splendor on the back of a lion or caparisoned in rags riding a gray horse.

Places: Tropical beaches, outdoors at sunrise or sunset, tanning salons, cathedrals, stone circles, fireworks shows.

Materials: Heliotropes and other tropical flowers, flashlights, cinnamon, “X” or cross shapes, laurel and hazel-wood, black-and-white (or black-and-red) checkerboard patterns.

## Phthenoth
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Impelling cleansing, restoration, and healing both physical and metaphorical, Phthenoth brings about the renaissance of body and spirit throughout reality. Repair of machines is the province of Ouare, although areas of overlap may exist for some golems and homunculi.

Aethyr: Shaliah, Lady of Material Happiness, may appear in many guises, but is almost always seen as a young, noble woman regardless of garb or impedimenta (which only very occasionally include the caduceus).

Places: Hospitals, health resorts, spring meadows after a rain, arches, fabled places of rest or healing.

Materials: Balm, pure water, apples, watered wine, chicken soup, potash, Greek (“+”) crosses, lavender.

## Roêlêd
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan imbues walls with their strength, thorns with their sharpness, shields with their glancing curves, antibiotics with their efficacy. Along with defense and guardianship, Roêlêd drives alertness, preparation, wisdom of experience, and that “sixth sense” that tells you you’re being watched. Many wraiths, and some trolls, derive mana from here.

Aethyr: Mahashiah, Lord of Valor, appears as a muscular, dark-feathered warrior holding a shield (often with a rattlesnake on it) and stabbing spear, or occasionally as a knight in armor or a watchman with a whip.

Places: Anywhere under surveillance or an with electric-eye grid, castles and fortresses, missile silos and radar stations, firebreaks, guardhouses.

Materials: Owl or raven feathers, ox-hide, “M” shapes, dragonsblood, unicorn horn, sirens and alarms, dog barks, tiger lilies, Kevlar, chain links, bronze (both the metal and the color).

## Ruax
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan creates strength of will, connects perceptions to the mind, and governs sanity, drunkenness, the hotter emotions, sleep, and the material phenomena of dreams (although their content may fall within another decan).

Aethyr: Deneyal, Lady of Dominion, usually appears either as a dark, physically imposing giantess or a queen clad in a white robe. Either form possesses fiery red eyes. Deneyal also occasionally appears as a songbird or a cat.

Places: Television studios or showrooms, hypnosis clinics or performances, drug parlors and opium dens, asylums, personal dreamscapes, memory palaces, certain lamaseries in Central Asia.

Materials: Cathode-ray tubes, spirals, poppies, downward-pointing arrows, cerulean blue.

## Sahu
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

The decan of the giants, Sahu impregnates concepts and activities such as archery, hunting, and herding as well as their physical associations such as mountains, forests, grasslands, and other wild spaces. For some reason, this decan also manifests in high stone walls; possibly as an analogy to mountains.

Aethyr: Orvandal, Lord of Material Trouble, appears as a giant, naked save for a belt and bow. His color ranges from blood red to forest green to basaltic black.

Places: Mountainsides, the walls of famous fortress-cities, the high veldt, imposing statues or stone structures such as Mount Rushmore or the Sphinx and Pyramids.

Materials: Basalt, sequoia wood, subsonics, arrowheads, sinew, fresh animal blood, opals, anything red and black.

## Saphathoraél
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan covers not only physical water (and more generally liquids), but conceptual water as well: that which “flows easily” or “is hard to pin down.” Like the other elemental decans, it likely plays a key role both underpinning physical reality and in blending conceptual reality so that humans can perceive it without massive dissonance.

Aethyr: Muumiah, Lord of Blended Pleasure, appears most often not as some great marine creature but as a sailor with two dogs (one green and one blue). Occasionally, he holds a serpent (or a stream of water) in one hand.

Places: Oceans, lakes, ships, reservoirs, wells and oases, ice rinks, sewers, islands to the west, the Plane of Water.

Materials: Fish, the blood of drowned men, aquamarines and beryl, pearls, teardrop shapes, chalices, lotuses, ferns, kelp, Irish whiskey, the color blue.

## Sphandôr
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

This decan manifests both as the sensorium and as the intellect, perhaps best understood as the passive counterpart to Ruax’s mental processes. In addition to things sensed and things thought (including arts and humanities), Sphandôr permits intuition and divination.

Aethyr: Umibael, the Lady of Shortened Force, appears as a snake, a wolf with a snake’s tail, a woman leading a roan mare and stallion, or a man with a surveyor’s rod.

Places: Computer rooms, hexagonal spaces, paintings or images of eyes, theatrical stages (especially the Globe), libraries (especially Alexandria).

Materials: Agates and cat’s eyes, musk, hexagons, fennel, ringing bells, russet-red.

## Tepsisem
[[The Ashgrove School/z-Reference/Magic/Decanic Correspondences#Decanic Correspondences\|#Decanic Correspondences]]

Much as Phoubêl makes immanent both light and darkness, Tepsisem gives rise to beauty and to its loss, and thus to transience and impermanence; steady diminution rather than the catastrophes of Marderô.

Aethyr: Livoyah, Lady of Loss, appears as a middle-aged woman in red, a scarlet fire-sprite, or a swift horsewoman on a red horse.

Places: Museums, art auction houses, badly maintained (but once attractive) buildings, eroding statues.

Materials: Works of art, rouge, acid rain, faded photographs, broken mirrors, velvet, sandalwood, cut hibiscus or lilies, scarlet.
